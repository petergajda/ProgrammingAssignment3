"train": Merged Dataframe including information of all volunteers, activities and measurements from the train group.

"test": Merged Dataframe including information of all volunteers, activities and measurements from the test group.



"data": Merged Dataframe including information of all volunteers, activities and measurements from the train and test group.

"dataenriched": Tidy dataset including information of all volunteers, activities and measurements from the train and test group. Colnames come from the features dataframe, the activities are declared with descriptive values from activity labels.

"meanstd_data": Dataset inlcludes only mean and standard deviation variables for each volunteer and activity. Requirement for Step 4 in the programming assignment.

"average_data" Dataset inlcludes aggregated means for all mean and standard deviation variables for each volunteer and activity. Requirement for Step 5 in the programming assignment.
